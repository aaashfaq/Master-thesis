Survival Rate Prediction using diagnostic images and immunoprofiles of Cancer Patients
In this Master thesis work, Multimodal Neural Netoworks were developed using immunoprofiles, MRI scans and CT scans. The designed multimodal neural network consists of ResNet-50 model for extracting the image features,feature embedding layer to extend the immunoprofile dataset to extracted image feature size, data fusion layer to concatenate the image and immunoprofiles feature together and a fully connected linear layer with one output unit for predicting one year survival prediction

Preprocessing folder contains the code used for preapring the data for the model.


Models folder contained the designed Multimodal neural Netowrks
